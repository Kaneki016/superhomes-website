Renting is often seen as easier than buying, but it comes with its own set of rules. Here is a guide to protect yourself and your wallet.

## Updated: The Standard "2 + 1 + 0.5" Deposit

When you rent a room or house, expect to pay these upfront costs:

1.  **Security Deposit (2 Months):** Refundable at the end of tenancy if no damage/arrears.
2.  **Advance Rental (1 Month):** Payment for the first month of stay.
3.  **Utilities Deposit (0.5 Month):** Refundable deposit for water/electricity.
4.  **Tenancy Agreement Fee:** Usually shared or paid by the tenant (~RM300 - RM500).

**Total Upfront:** Roughly **3.5 months'** worth of rent.

## The Tenancy Agreement

Never rent without a black-and-white agreement. Ensure it covers:
*   **Tenancy Period:** Usually 1 year or 2 years.
*   **Renewal Clause:** Option to renew at the same rent or capped increase.
*   **Exit Clause:** What happens if you need to leave early? (Diplomatic clause is useful for expats).
*   **Inventory List:** Detailed list of furniture provided (Check this carefully!).

## Tenant's Rights & Duties

### Rights:
*   **Quiet Enjoyment:** The landlord cannot bargain in without notice.
*   **Habitable Home:** Everything major (plumbing, roof) must work.

### Duties:
*   **Pay Rent On Time:** usually within the first 7 days.
*   **Minor Repairs:** Changing lightbulbs or fuses is usually on you.
*   **Utility Bills:** Pay TNB, Water, and Internet bills promptly.

## How to Find a Rental

1.  **Determine Budget:** Rent should generally be < 30% of your income.
2.  **Explore Locations:**
    *   Working in KL? Try [Sentul](/rent?search=Sentul) or [Wangsa Maju](/rent?search=Wangsa+Maju) for affordability + connectivity.
    *   Tech worker? [Cyberjaya](/rent?search=Cyberjaya) is a major hub.
3.  **Inspect:** Check water pressure, phone signal, and noise levels.

## Moving Out checklist
1.  Give notice as per agreement (usually 2 months).
2.  Restore house to original condition (exclude fair wear and tear).
3.  Pay all outstanding bills.
4.  Attend the final inspection to ensure you get your full deposit back!
