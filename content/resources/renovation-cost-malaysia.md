Buying the house is just the first step. Turning it into a home often involves renovation. But how much should you set aside? Renovation costs in Malaysia can vary wildly depending on the extent of work, materials chosen, and the contractor you hire.

This guide provides a ballpark estimation to help you plan your renovation budget effectively.

## General Cost Estimates (Per Square Foot)
As a rule of thumb, you can estimate costs based on the "intensity" of the renovation:

1.  **Basic Makeover (touch-ups, paint, minor repairs):** RM20 - RM50 psf
2.  **Standard Renovation (new flooring, built-ins, plaster ceiling):** RM60 - RM100 psf
3.  **Extensive/Premium Renovation (structural changes, hacking, premium materials):** RM110 - RM200+ psf

*Example: For a 1,000 sqft condo unit doing a standard renovation, budget around RM60,000 to RM100,000.*

## Breakdown by Area

### 1. Wet Works (Hacking & Tiling)
This is usually the most expensive part.
*   **Hacking walls/tiles:** RM1,500 - RM3,000 per area.
*   **Tiling:** Labor costs range from RM6 - RM15 psf (excluding tile cost).
*   **Cement rendering:** RM15 - RM25 psf.

### 2. Kitchen Cabinets
The heart of the home. Prices are usually per "foot run" (FR).
*   **Melamine (Budget):** RM100 - RM300 per foot run.
*   **4G Glass / Acrylic (Mid-Range):** RM400 - RM600 per foot run.
*   **Solid Wood / Aluminium (Premium):** RM700 - RM1,200+ per foot run.
*   *Add countertop costs:* Quartz stone is popular, ranging from RM180 - RM350 per foot run.

### 3. Flooring
*   **Laminate/SPC Flooring:** RM5 - RM12 psf (supply & install). Very popular for bedrooms.
*   **Tiles (Ceramic/Porcelain):** RM10 - RM30 psf depending on size and quality.
*   **Solid Wood / Parquet:** RM25 - RM50+ psf.

### 4. Plaster Ceiling & Lighting
*   **Flat plaster ceiling:** RM3 - RM5 psf.
*   **L-Box / Light trough:** RM15 - RM25 per foot run.
*   **Wiring points:** RM60 - RM150 per point depending on complexity.

### 5. Wardrobes
*   **Built-in wardrobes:** RM400 - RM800 per foot run depending on height (ceiling height vs standard) and material.

## Hidden Costs to Watch Out For
*   **Debris hauling:** RM300 - RM500 per trip.
*   **Plumbing relocation:** Can get costly if you move sinks or toilets far from original piping.
*   **Air-cond piping:** RM250 - RM400 per unit point.
*   **Contingency Fund:** Always add **15-20%** on top of your final quote for unexpected issues.

## Conclusion
Renovation is an investment in your lifestyle and property value. To save costs, prioritize essential works (electrical, plumbing, flooring) first, and do cosmetic upgrades (feature walls, expensive furniture) later. Always get at least 3 quotes from different contractors to compare market rates.
