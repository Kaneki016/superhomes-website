A **Tenancy Agreement** is a legally binding contract between a landlord and a tenant. It defines the duties, responsibilities, and rights of both parties.

While you can write one yourself, it's safer to have it drafted by a professional or use a standard standard template.

## What Should Be In The Agreement?

### 1. Details of Property & Parties
*   Full names and IC/Passport numbers of Landlord and Tenant.
*   The exact address of the property (including unit number).

### 2. Tenancy Period & Renewal
*   **Duration:** Typically 1 or 2 years.
*   **Renewal Option:** Usually allows the tenant to renew for another year at a pre-agreed rental rate (or market rate).

### 3. Deposits
*   **Security Deposit:** Usually 2 months' rent. Refundable at the end of the tenancy (minus damages).
*   **Utility Deposit:** Usually 0.5 or 1 month's rent. For unpaid water/electricity bills.
*   **Earnest Deposit:** 1 month's rent paid to book the unit (becomes the first month's rent).

### 4. Obligations
*   **Landlord:** Pay assessment tax, quit rent, and insurance. Maintain structure (roof, piping).
*   **Tenant:** Pay rent on time, pay utilities, take care of furniture, and do minor repairs (e.g., changing lightbulbs).

### 5. Termination Clause
*   What happens if the tenant leaves early? (Usually, the deposit is forfeited).
*   What happens if the landlord sells the house? (The tenancy usually continues with the new owner, or the landlord pays compensation).

## Stamp Duty Calculation (2026)

A tenancy agreement is **only legal if stamped** by LHDN (Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri).

**The Formula:**
*   **Rental > RM2,400/year:** (Yearly Rent - RM2,400) / 250 * RM1 (for 1 year) or RM2 (for 1-3 years).

**Example: RM2,000 monthly rent (RM24,000 / year) for 1 year**
1.  Taxable rental = RM24,000 - RM2,400 = RM21,600
2.  Stamp Duty = RM21,600 / 250 * RM1 = **RM87** (rounded up).

## Who Pays Legal Fees?
Usually, the **Tenant** pays for the Stamp Duty and the administration fees for drafting the agreement.

## Checklist Before Signing
1.  **Inventory List:** Take photos of all furniture and defects *before* moving in.
2.  **Diplomatic Clause:** If you are an expat, ensure this clause exists so you can break the lease if you are transferred out of Malaysia.
3.  **Payment Mode:** Agree on whether it's bank transfer or JomPAY.
