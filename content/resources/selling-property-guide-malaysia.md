Selling a property is just as complex as buying one. From setting the right price to paying taxes, here is your roadmap to a successful sale.

## Step 1: Check the Market Value

Before listing, know what your home is worth.
*   **Bank Valuation:** Get a verbal indication from a banker.
*   **Market Research:** Check similar listings on **Superhomes** in your area.
*   **Don't Overprice:** An overpriced home sits on the market for months, becoming "stale".

## Step 2: Appoint a Real Estate Agent

You can sell it yourself (DIY), but an experienced agent can handle potential buyers and negotiation.
*   **Fees:** Standard agency fee is **2-3%** of the selling price + SST.
*   **Exclusive vs. General:** Exclusive means only one agent sells it (more dedication); General allows multiple agents.

## Step 3: Prepare the House ("Staging")

First impressions count.
*   **Declutter:** Remove personal items and excess furniture.
*   **Repaint:** A fresh coat of white paint makes spaces look bigger.
*   **Repairs:** Fix leaking taps and fused bulbs.

## Step 4: Costs of Selling

Be prepared for these deductions from your profit:
1.  **RPGT (Real Property Gains Tax):** Tax on your profit.
    *   *See our full [RPGT Article](/resources/rpgt-rates-malaysia) for rates.*
2.  **Legal Fees:** To discharge the bank loan and draft documents.
3.  **Agency Fees:** The 2-3% mentioned above.
4.  **CKHT Remittance:** Your lawyer retains 3% of the sale price to pay LHDN for RPGT purposes.

## Step 5: Accepting an Offer & Booking

When a buyer makes an offer you accept:
1.  They pay a **2-3% Earnest Deposit** (booking fee).
2.  They sign a "Letter of Offer to Purchase".
3.  **Important:** Ensure the letter states that the deposit is refundable if their loan is rejected (standard practice).

## Step 6: Signing the SPA

Within 14-21 days, both parties sign the Sales & Purchase Agreement (SPA).
*   Buyer pays the remaining deposit (totaling 10%).

## Step 7: Settlement & Handover

*   **Timeline:** Usually **3+1 months** (90 days + 30 days extension) to complete the transaction.
*   Once the full payment is disbursed by the buyer's bank to your bank (to settle your loan) and then to you, you hand over the keys and access cards.
