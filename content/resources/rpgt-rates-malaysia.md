If you sell a property in Malaysia for a profit, the government takes a cut. This tax is known as the **Real Property Gains Tax (RPGT)**. It was introduced to curb property speculation, ensuring that housing remains affordable for genuine buyers.

Whether you are "flipping" a house or selling your family home to upgrade, understanding RPGT is essential to calculate your actual net profit.

## What is RPGT?
RPGT is a tax charged on the profit (gain) derived from the disposal of real property. The rate depends on:
1.  **Who you are** (Citizen, Permanent Resident, Foreigner, or Company).
2.  **How long you have owned the property** (Retention period).

## RPGT Rates Table (Effective 2025)

| Retention Period (Years) | Malaysian Citizens & PRs | Foreigners & Non-Citizens | Companies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Within 1 Year | 30% | 30% | 30% |
| Within 2 Years | 30% | 30% | 30% |
| Within 3 Years | 30% | 30% | 30% |
| Within 4 Years | 20% | 30% | 20% |
| Within 5 Years | 15% | 30% | 15% |
| More than 5 Years (6th Year onwards) | **0%** | 10% | 10% |

*> Note: For Malaysian citizens, if you sell after the 5th year, you pay 0% RPGT. This is a significant incentive for long-term holding.*

## How is RPGT Calculated?
RPGT is calculated on the **Chargeable Gain**, not the total selling price.

**Formula:**
`Chargeable Gain = Disposal Price - Acquisition Price - Allowable Expenses`

*   **Acquisition Price:** The price you bought it for.
*   **Disposal Price:** The price you are selling it for.
*   **Allowable Expenses:** Fees like legal fees, stamp duty, estate agent commission, and renovation costs (enhancements).

**Example Calculation:**
*   Bought in 2020: RM500,000
*   Sold in 2023 (3 years ownership): RM700,000
*   **Gross Profit:** RM200,000
*   **RPGT Rate:** 30% (Sold within 3 years)
*   **Tax Payable:** RM200,000 x 30% = **RM60,000**

## Exemptions
There are ways to legally avoid or reduce RPGT:

1.  **Once-in-a-Lifetime Exemption:** Malaysian citizens can apply for a one-time exemption for the disposal of a private residence.
2.  **Family Transfer:** Transfer of property between family members (Parent ↔ Child, Husband ↔ Wife, Grandparent ↔ Grandchild) by way of love and affection is 100% exempt.
3.  **Low-Cost Housing:** Disposal of low-cost, low-medium cost, and affordable housing priced below RM200,000 is exempt.

## Conclusion
RPGT can take a significant chunk out of your profits if you sell too soon. Ideally, for Malaysians, holding a property for more than 5 years is the best strategy to maximize returns tax-free.
