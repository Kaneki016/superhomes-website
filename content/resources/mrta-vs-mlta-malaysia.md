When applying for a home loan in Malaysia, the bank will almost always ask: **"Do you want MRTA or MLTA?"**

While buying mortgage insurance isn't legally mandatory, most banks highly recommend it (and may even offer a better interest rate if you take it). But which one should you choose?

## What is MRTA?
**Mortgage Reducing Term Assurance**

MRTA is an insurance plan where the **sum assured reduces over time**. It is designed solely to pay off your outstanding home loan if you pass away or suffer Total Permanent Disability (TPD).

### Pros
*   **Cheaper:** Generally much more affordable than MLTA.
*   **One-time Payment:** You pay a single lump sum upfront (which can be bundled into your loan).
*   **Simple:** Pure protection for the bank loan amount.

### Cons
*   **Decreasing Coverage:** As your loan balance drops, so does your protection.
*   **Non-transferable:** If you sell the house or refinance, the MRTA usually ends (with a small surrender value).
*   **No Cash Value:** You get nothing back at the end of the tenure.

## What is MLTA?
**Mortgage Level Term Assurance**

MLTA is an insurance plan where the **sum assured remains constant** (level) throughout the tenure. It is often a mix of life insurance and savings/investment.

### Pros
*   **Constant Coverage:** Even as you pay off your loan, the payout amount stays high.
*   **Cash Value:** You may get money back at the end of the tenure.
*   **Transferable:** You can use the same policy for your next property.
*   **Extra Protection:** Since the loan balance drops but coverage stays level, any extra payout goes to your family.

### Cons
*   **Expensive:** Premiums can be 2x or 3x higher than MRTA.
*   **Periodic Payments:** You pay monthly, quarterly, or yearly (recurring cost).

## Comparison at a Glance

| Feature | MRTA | MLTA |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sum Assured** | Decreasing | Level (Constant) |
| **Cost** | Low (Lump sum) | High (Periodic) |
| **Beneficiary** | Bank (First) | Family / Nominee |
| **Transferable?** | No | Yes |
| **Best For** | Budget buyers, long-term homeowners | Investors, sole breadwinners |

## Which Should You Choose?

### Choose MRTA if:
1.  **Budget is tight:** You want the lowest possible entry cost.
2.  **Forever Home:** You plan to live in this property for the next 20-30 years.
3.  **Single/No Dependents:** You just need to ensure the debt is cleared.

### Choose MLTA if:
1.  **Investment:** You plan to sell or upgrade in 5-10 years (policy can follow you).
2.  **Family Protection:** You want your family to receive extra cash on top of clearing the loan.
3.  **Liquidity:** You prefer paying monthly rather than a huge lump sum upfront.

## Final Verdict
Don't just blindly accept what the banker offers. If you already have sufficient Life Insurance coverage elsewhere, a basic MRTA might be enough. However, if you are an active property investor, the flexibility of MLTA allows you to protect multiple properties over your lifetime.
