The biggest hurdle for most homebuyers is the upfront cash, specifically the **downpayment**. Here is a detailed look at how it works and how you can fund it.

## The Standard Rule: 10%

For a standard housing loan in Malaysia (90% Margin of Finance), you are required to pay the remaining **10%** in cash.

*   **Example:**
    *   House Price: RM500,000
    *   Loan Amount (90%): RM450,000
    *   **Downpayment (10%): RM50,000**

## Can I Buy with 0% Downpayment?

Yes, it is possible in certain scenarios:

### 1. New Launch Rebates
Developers often offer "early bird rebates" or "bumi discounts" that offset the downpayment.
*   *Example:* A 10% rebate means the developer absorbs the downpayment cost. You essentially borrow 90% but don't pay the initial 10% cash.

### 2. My First Home Scheme (Skim Rumah Pertamaku)
This scheme allows eligible first-time buyers to obtain **110% financing**, covering the price plus valuation fees.

### 3. 100% Loans for Government Servants
Civil servants can apply for LPPSA loans which offer full financing.

## Sources of Funds for Downpayment

If you need to pay that 10%, here is where you can find the money:

### 1. EPF Account 2 Withdrawal
You are allowed to withdraw funds from your EPF (KWSP) Account 2 to pay for the downpayment or reduce the housing loan.
*   **Limit:** The difference between the house price and the loan amount + 10%.
*   **Process:** Apply via i-Akaun online.

### 2. Review Your Low-Yield Assets
Consider liquidating fixed deposits or stocks that are underperforming compared to the potential appreciation of the property (or the savings on rent).

### 3. Family Assistance "Bank of Mum and Dad"
Many first-time buyers receive a "soft loan" or gift from parents to bridge the gap.

## Hidden Costs to Remember (Not just Downpayment!)
Remember to save an additional **3-5%** for:
*   **SPA Legal Fees & Stamp Duty**
*   **Loan Agreement Fees & Stamp Duty**
*   **Valuation Fees**

**Tool:** Use our [Stamp Duty Calculator](/resources/stamp-duty-calculator-malaysia) to estimate these extra costs.

## Summary
Saving for a downpayment takes discipline. Start early, automate your savings, and explore developer offers if cash is tight.
