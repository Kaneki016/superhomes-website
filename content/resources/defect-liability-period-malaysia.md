Keys in hand! Excitement is high. But before you start renovating, you must inspect the property. For primary market (new launch) properties in Malaysia, you are protected by a warranty known as the **Defect Liability Period (DLP)**.

This is your rights as a buyer to get the developer to fix issues for free. Here is how to navigate it.

## What is DLP?
The DLP is essentially a warranty period typically lasting **24 months** from the date you receive Vacant Possession (VP)—basically, the day you get your keys.
*   During this time, the developer is responsible for repairing any defects due to poor workmanship or materials.
*   *Note:* Sub-sale (second-hand) properties are usually sold on an "as-is-where-is" basis and do NOT have DLP unless negotiated otherwise.

## Common Defects to Look For
Don't just look; test everything.
1.  **Cracks:** Hairline cracks are common, but wide cracks on beams or columns are serious structural concerns.
2.  **Water Marks/Leakage:** Check ceilings (especially in bathrooms) and window edges.
3.  **Uneven Tiling:** Tap tiles with a coin. "Hollow" sounds indicate improper bonding (potential to pop up later).
4.  **Doors & Windows:** Do they close smoothly? Are the locks working?
5.  **Electrical & Plumbing:** Turn on every tap, switch on every light. Bring a phone charger to test sockets.

## The Process: How to Claim
1.  **Do Not Renovate Yet:** Renovating usually voids the DLP for the affected area. Inspect first!
2.  **Mark the Defects:** Use masking tape to physically mark defects on walls/floors.
3.  **Submit the Form:** Your management office or developer will provide a defect complaint form. Submit this form with photos.
4.  **The 30-Day Rule:** The developer generally has 30 days to carry out repairs.
5.  **Re-Inspection:** Once they say it's done, inspect again. If not satisfied, do not sign off.

## What If They Ignore Me?
If the developer fails to repair within 30 days, you (the buyer) can assert your rights:
1.  Notify them in writing that you will hire your own contractor.
2.  Get a quote and send it to the developer, giving them another 14 days.
3.  If still no action, you can proceed to repair and deduct the cost from the stakeholder sum (the 5% retention sum held by the lawyers). *Consult a lawyer for this step.*

## Conclusion
Getting the keys is just the start. The DLP is your safety net. Be thorough, be strict, and ensure you get the quality you paid for before you move in.
