When you buy a "New Launch" or "Under Construction" condo in Malaysia, you don't pay the full loan installment immediately. Instead, you pay according to the **Progressive Payment Schedule**.

This schedule is regulated under **Schedule H** of the Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act (HDA).

## How It Works
The developer claims money from your bank in stages, as they complete construction milestones.

1.  **Stage 1:** Signing SPA (10% paid by you as downpayment).
2.  **Stage 2a:** Piling & Foundation (10%).
3.  **Stage 2b:** Structural Framework (15%).
...and so on until Vacant Possession.

## The Schedule (Simplified)

| Stage | Milestone | % of Price | Cumulative % |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Signing SPA | 10% | 10% |
| 2a | Work below ground level (Piling) | 10% | 20% |
| 2b | Structural Compliance (Frame) | 15% | 35% |
| 2c | Walls, Doors, Window Frames | 10% | 45% |
| 2d | Roofing / Ceiling / Wiring | 10% | 55% |
| 2e | Internal Plastering | 2.5% | 57.5% |
| 2f | Sewerage Works | 5% | 62.5% |
| 2g | Drains | 5% | 67.5% |
| 2h | Roads | 5% | 72.5% |
| 3 | Vacant Possession (Keys) | 17.5% | 90% |
| 4 | Final Title Transfer | 10% | 100% |

*Note: The remaining 5% is usually held by lawyers as stakeholding for the Defect Liability Period.*

## Progressive Interest
Since the bank releases money in stages, you only pay interest on the **amount released so far**. This is called **Progressive Interest**.

*   **Year 1:** You might only pay RM100-RM300/month (since only ~10-20% is released).
*   **Year 3:** As the building nears completion (70-80% released), you might pay RM1,500/month.
*   **Completion:** You pay the full installment (e.g., RM2,500/month).

## Why Is This Good?
*   **Easier Cash Flow:** You don't have the burden of full rental + full mortgage at the same time while waiting for the house to be built.
*   **Safety:** The developer only gets paid if they actually do the work.
