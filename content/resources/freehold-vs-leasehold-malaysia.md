When browsing property listings, you’ll often see terms like "Freehold", "Leasehold", or "Bumi Lot" highlighted. These aren't just legal jargon; they essentially dictate your ownership rights, the property's value, and how easy it is to sell in the future.

Here is a simple breakdown to help you choose the right title.

## 1. Freehold
**"Ownership Forever"**
This is the most preferred title. When you buy a Freehold property, you own the land (and the building) indefinitely.
*   **Pros:**
    *   No time limit on ownership.
    *   Easier to sell (transferring ownership is faster as it usually doesn't require state consent).
    *   Generally commands a higher resale value.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Often more expensive than leasehold properties in the same area.
    *   *Note:* Even Freehold land can be acquired by the government for public infrastructure (e.g., MRT tracks) under the Land Acquisition Act, though with compensation.

## 2. Leasehold
**"Ownership for a Fixed Time"**
You own the property for a fixed duration, usually **99 years** (sometimes 60 or 30). Once the lease expires, the land reverts to the State Government unless you renew the lease (which costs money).
*   **Pros:**
    *   Entry price is usually lower (cheaper) than Freehold.
    *   Often located in prime, mature locations (e.g., parts of PJ, Sunway) where location value outweighs the title type.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Value stagnation:** As the remaining lease tenure drops (especially below 50-60 years), financing becomes harder, and property value may stagnate or drop.
    *   **Transfer Consent:** Selling a leasehold property requires State Consent, which can take 3-6 months or longer to process.

## 3. Bumi Lot
**"Reserved for Bumiputeras"**
Developers are required to reserve a certain percentage of units (usually 30% or more depending on the state) for Bumiputera buyers. These units often come with a **Bumi Discount** (e.g., 7% to 15%).
*   **The Restriction:** These lots can usually only be sold to other Bumiputeras.
*   **Can a Non-Bumi Buy a Bumi Lot?**
    *   Generally, **NO**.
    *   **"Bumi Released" Lots:** In some cases, if a developer cannot sell the Bumi lots after years of trying, they can apply to the State to "release" them to the open market. This allows non-Bumis to buy. However, these are specific cases and the property might revert to Bumi restriction upon resale (check the land title!).

## 4. Malay Reserve Land (Tanah Rizab Melayu)
This is even stricter than Bumi Lot. It can **ONLY** be owned by Malay Muslims. It cannot be owned by non-Malay Bumiputeras or foreigners. Properties on this land are usually significantly cheaper but have a very limited market for resale.

## Conclusion: Which Should You Choose?
*   **For Investment:** Freehold is safer for capital appreciation and ease of selling.
*   **For Own Stay:** If the location is perfect (e.g., near your work and family) and the price is right, Leasehold is perfectly fine. Ideally, ensure the remaining lease is still long (80+ years).
*   **For Non-Bumis:** Avoid Bumi Lots unless they are officially "Released" with clear documentation.
