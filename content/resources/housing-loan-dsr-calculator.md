You’ve found your dream home. The price looks okay. But will the bank agree? Securing a housing loan in Malaysia isn't just about your salary; it's about your entire financial health.

This guide breaks down the types of loans and the crucial **Debt Service Ratio (DSR)** formula that banks use to approve (or reject) you.

## Types of Housing Loans
### 1. Basic Term Loan
*   **How it works:** Rigid. You pay a fixed installment for the entire tenure (e.g., 30 years).
*   **Pros:** Discipline. You know exactly what you pay.
*   **Cons:** If you have extra cash and pay more, it doesn't reduce the loan interest unless you write in to request it (and usually can't withdraw it back).

### 2. Semi-Flexi Loan
*   **How it works:** You can pay extra to lower the principal (and interest), but withdrawing that extra cash requires a request and a fee (usually RM50).
*   **Pros:** Good balance of flexibility and structure.

### 3. Full-Flexi Loan
*   **How it works:** Linked to a current account. Depositing money instantly reduces the loan interest. You can withdraw the money anytime via ATM/Online Transfer.
*   **Pros:** Maximum interest savings for those with fluctuating cash flow (e.g., business owners).
*   **Cons:** Usually has a monthly maintenance fee (e.g., RM10).

## Understanding DSR (Debt Service Ratio)
This is the **#1 reason** loans get rejected. DSR measures how much of your income goes to paying debts.

**Formula:**
`DSR = (Total Monthly Commitments + New Loan Installment) / Net Monthly Income x 100`

*   **Total Monthly Commitments:** Car loan, PTPTN, credit card minimum, personal loans.
*   **Net Monthly Income:** Income after EPF, SOCSO, and Tax types.

### What is a "Good" DSR?
Banks have different thresholds, but generally:
*   **Income < RM3,000:** DSR should be < 60%.
*   **Income > RM3,000:** DSR limit might go up to 70% or 80%.

### Example
*   **Net Salary:** RM4,000
*   **Existing Commitments:** RM1,000 (Car + PTPTN)
*   **New House Installment:** RM1,500
*   **Total Commitment:** RM2,500
*   **DSR:** (2,500 / 4,000) x 100 = **62.5%**
*   *Verdict:* Likely approved (borderline safe).

## Margin of Finance
*   **Home 1 & 2:** You can usually get a **90% loan**.
*   **Home 3 onwards:** The limit drops to **70%**.

## Conclusion
Before booking a unit, calculate your DSR. If it's too high, clear some small debts (like credit cards) to boost your eligibility. Getting a pre-approval check with a banker is always a smart move.
