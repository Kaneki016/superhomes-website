**Top 5 Condos to Buy or Rent in Setiawangsa & Ampang (2026 Guide)**

The residential landscape of Eastern Kuala Lumpur is defined by two distinct yet complementary neighbours: **Setiawangsa** and **Ampang**. Setiawangsa, often dubbed the "Hollywood Hills" of Kuala Lumpur due to its elevated terrain and affluent demographics, offers a serene suburban retreat just 4km from the city centre. Conversely, Ampang serves as the diplomatic heart of the nation, bridging the ultra-luxury "Embassy Row" with mature suburban townships.

For homebuyers and investors in 2026, these areas offer a compelling mix of transit-oriented developments (TODs), heritage-rich landed enclaves, and modern high-rises.
