Buying your first home is a huge milestone, but the process can be overwhelming. This guide breaks down the journey into 10 clear steps to help you navigate the Malaysian property market with confidence.

## Step 1: Calculate Your Affordability

Before looking at houses, you need to know what you can afford.
*   **Debt Service Ratio (DSR):** Banks usually lend up to 70% of your net income (minus existing commitments).
*   **Rule of Thumb:** Your monthly installment should not exceed one-third of your gross income.

**Pro Tip:** Use our [Home Loan Calculator](/resources/housing-loan-dsr-calculator) to estimate your monthly repayments.

## Step 2: Save for Upfront Costs

Buying a house requires more than just the loan. You need cash for:
*   **Downpayment:** Typically 10% of the property price.
*   **Legal Fees:** For the Sales & Purchase Agreement (SPA) and Loan Agreement.
*   **Stamp Duty:** Tax on the transfer of ownership (MOT) and loan documents.
*   **Valuation Fees:** For sub-sale properties.

## Step 3: Choose: Under Construction (New) or Sub-Sale (Used)?

| Feature | New Projects | Sub-Sale Properties |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Price** | Often have rebates/discounts | Negotiable prices |
| **Condition** | Brand new, defect warranty | "As is where is", may need repair |
| **Waiting Time** | 2-3 years to complete | Move in immediately (2-3 months) |
| **Warranties** | [Defect Liability Period](/resources/defect-liability-period-malaysia) | No warranty |

## Step 4: House Hunting

Start your search online on platforms like **Superhomes** or PropWall.
*   Filter by budget and location.
*   Visit showrooms or open houses.
*   Check the neighborhood at different times of day (traffic, noise).

**Popular Areas for First-Timers:** [Cheras](/buy?search=Cheras), [Puchong](/buy?search=Puchong), [Shah Alam](/buy?search=Shah+Alam).

## Step 5: Booking & Letter of Offer

Once you find "the one":
1.  Pay a booking fee (usually 2-3%).
2.  Sign the **Letter of Offer** (for sub-sale) or Booking Form (for new projects).

## Step 6: Apply for a Loan

Apply to 3-4 banks to compare rates. Documents needed:
*   IC copy
*   3-6 months payslips
*   Bank statements
*   EPF statement
*   EA form (for tax info)

## Step 7: Hire a Lawyer & Sign SPA

Appoint a lawyer to handle the legal paperwork. You will sign:
*   **Sales & Purchase Agreement (SPA)**
*   **Loan Agreement**
*   **Memorandum of Transfer (MOT)** (later stage for detailed titles)

## Step 8: Pay the Balance

*   **New Projects:** Progressive payment usage (bank releases money as construction progresses).
*   **Sub-Sale:** Pay the remaining 90% (via loan) usually within 90 days of signing SPA.

## Step 9: Delivery of Vacant Possession (VP)

For new homes, this is when you get the keys!
*   Conduct a defect inspection immediately.
*   Submit any defect claims to the developer.

## Step 10: Renovation & Move-In

*   Apply for renovation permits if hacking walls.
*   Set up utilities (TNB, Air Selangor, Internet).
*   Planning a renovation? Check our [Renovation Cost Guide](/resources/renovation-cost-malaysia).
