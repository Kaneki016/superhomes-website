**Malaysia Budget 2026: Property Incentives and What They Mean for Buyers & Investors**

The **Malaysia Budget 2026**, tabled on 10 October 2025, marks a pivotal shift in the nation’s real estate landscape. Anchored by the **Ekonomi MADANI** framework, the budget transitions from broad-based stimulus to targeted structural reforms aimed at enhancing fiscal resilience and social equity.

For property buyers and investors, Budget 2026 introduces a mix of extended support for affordable homeownership and tightening measures for foreign investment. This comprehensive guide analyses the Malaysia Budget 2026 property incentives, eligibility criteria, and the broader implications for the housing market.

## Key Property Incentives for First-Time Homebuyers

The government continues to prioritize homeownership for the rakyat, specifically targeting the B40 and M40 income groups. The following measures are designed to reduce the upfront costs of acquiring a home.

### 1. Extension of Stamp Duty Exemption
A cornerstone of the first-time home buyer incentives Malaysia is the extension of the stamp duty exemption.

*   **Incentive:** 100% stamp duty exemption on the instrument of transfer and loan agreement.
*   **Eligibility:** Malaysian citizens purchasing their first residential home.
*   **Property Value Cap:** Applicable for homes valued up to RM500,000.
*   **Timeline:** The exemption, originally set to expire earlier, has been extended for Sale and Purchase Agreements (SPA) executed from **1 January 2026 to 31 December 2027**.

This extension provides a significant window for aspiring homeowners to secure properties in the entry-level market without the burden of transfer taxes, which typically cost thousands of Ringgit.

### 2. Expanded Housing Credit Guarantee Scheme (SJKP)
To democratize access to financing, particularly for those without fixed incomes (such as gig workers and small business owners), the government has bolstered the Housing Credit Guarantee Scheme (SJKP).

*   **Guarantee Ceiling:** Increased by RM10 billion, bringing the total guarantee capacity to **RM20 billion**.
*   **Target Group:** Approximately 80,000 potential borrowers, specifically those without formal salary slips or fixed incomes.
*   **Special Provision:** A guarantee of up to 120% of the house price is available for first-time buyers, covering the down payment and related costs.
*   **Step-Up Financing:** Introduction of a mechanism to lower monthly installments for the first five years to ease cash flow for young buyers.

### 3. Enhanced Financing for Public Servants (LPPSA)
The Public Sector Home Financing Board (LPPSA) has introduced reforms to assist civil servants in coping with rising property prices in urban centers.

*   **New Eligibility Limit:** The maximum financing eligibility is raised to **RM1 million**.
*   **Second Financing:** Public servants will be permitted to apply for second financing without fully settling their first loan, provided the total amount remains within their eligibility limit. This measure is expected to take effect in the fourth quarter of 2026.
*   **Young Civil Servants:** The Youth Housing Financing Scheme is extended until 31 December 2026, benefiting those aged 30 and below.

## Major Policy Changes for Foreign Buyers and Investors

In a move to curb speculation and prioritize local ownership, Budget 2026 introduces a significant cooling measure affecting the **Malaysia property tax relief 2026** landscape for non-citizens.

### 2. Real Property Gains Tax (RPGT) Administration Reform
While RPGT rates remain unchanged, the administration of tax collection has been refined to improve cash flow for sellers.

*   **Retention Sum Update:** Effective 1 January 2026, when a disposer submits the RPGT tax return, if the tax assessment is lower than the retention sum (usually 3% of the transaction value), the acquirer is only required to remit the actual tax amount to the Inland Revenue Board (IRB), rather than the full retention sum.
