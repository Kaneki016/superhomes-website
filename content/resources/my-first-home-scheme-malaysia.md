**Skim Rumah Pertamaku (SRP)** was launched to help young homebuyers purchase their first property without needing the hefty 10% downpayment. It is guaranteed by Cagamas SRP Berhad.

## Key Benefit: 110% Financing

Unlike normal loans (90%), SRP allows participating banks to offer **up to 110% financing**.
*   100% covers the house price.
*   10% covers the insurance (MRTA/MRTT) and related fees.
*   **Result:** You pay **RM0 downpayment** upfront.

## Eligibility Criteria

To qualify for SRP, you must meet these requirements:

1.  **Citizenship:** Malaysian citizen.
2.  **First Home:** Must be your very first residential property.
3.  **Owner Occupied:** You must live in the property (not for investment/renting out).
4.  **Age:** No age limit (previously was restricted to under 40, now open subject to bank tenure).
5.  **Income:**
    *   Gross monthly household income not exceeding **RM10,000**.
    *   (Individual applicants: Gross income <= RM5,000 for some banks, check specific bank terms).
6.  **Employment:** Confirmed employee with at least 6 months service OR self-employed with 2 years track record.

## Property Requirements

*   **Type:** Residential properties (completed or under construction).
*   **Location:** Within Malaysia.
*   **Price:** Maximum property value of **RM500,000**.

## Participating Banks

Most major banks in Malaysia participate, including:
*   Maybank
*   CIMB
*   Public Bank
*   RHB
*   AmBank
*   Hong Leong Bank
*   Bank Islam

## How to Apply?

You do not apply at a government office. Instead:
1.  Find a property valued under RM500k.
2.  Go to a participating bank.
3.  Tell the loan officer you want to apply under **Skim Rumah Pertamaku**.

## Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- |
| **No Downpayment:** Greatest advantage. | **Higher Monthly Installment:** Since you borrow 100%+, your monthly repayment is higher. |
| **Easier Entry:** Good for those with income but low savings. | **Strict Credit Check:** Banks are strict on DSR since the loan risk is higher. |

## Is it Right for You?
If you have a steady income but haven't managed to save RM30k-RM50k for a downpayment yet, this scheme is your best path to homeownership.
