## 1. 2024–2025 Performance Recap: A Market in Calibration

The years 2024 and 2025 marked a period of resilience and correction for the Klang Valley property outlook. Following the post-pandemic recovery, the market began to stabilize, moving away from speculative spikes toward sustainable growth.

### Market Activity and Volume
Data from the **National Property Information Centre (NAPIC)** indicates that the Central Region property market improved significantly in 2024. The region recorded 99,817 transactions worth RM103.27 billion, representing a 4.7% increase in volume and a robust 29.9% increase in value compared to 2023. Specifically, Selangor dominated the market share with 77.9% of transactions, while Kuala Lumpur contributed 21.7%.

### Price Movements
In terms of pricing, the market witnessed a steady upward trajectory. The **All House Price Index** for Kuala Lumpur stood at 202.5 points in 2024 (preliminary), up from 198.2 in 2023, with the average house price rising to **RM803,846**. Similarly, Selangor saw its index rise to 229.9 points, with average prices hitting **RM557,425**.

### Cheras Specifics
For Cheras specifically, transactions have reflected a distinct split between its KL and Selangor portions. Median transacted prices for terrace houses in **Cheras KL** hovered around **RM705,000** (RM432 psf), while **Cheras Selangor** recorded a median of **RM580,000** (RM422 psf) in recent periods. This price gap highlights the premium paid for proximity to the city centre, despite the age of many KL-side properties.

## 2. Property Price Forecast for 2026

The Cheras house price forecast for 2026 is heavily influenced by Malaysia’s [Budget 2026](/resources/malaysia-budget-2026-property-incentives) and the shifting supply dynamics in the Klang Valley.

### Impact of Budget 2026
The extension of the stamp duty exemption for first-time homebuyers purchasing properties priced at RM500,000 or below until 31 December 2027 is a critical driver for 2026. This policy directly benefits the secondary market in mature Cheras neighbourhoods and new mass-market high-rise launches. With the sub-RM500,000 segment accounting for nearly 78% of transactions in 2023, this measure ensures sustained demand for affordable units.

### Price Appreciation
While luxury units face slower absorption, the **mid-tier market (RM300,001–RM600,000)** is expected to see stable appreciation. The Malaysian House Price Index recorded slow annual growth of 0.9% in early 2025, suggesting a predictable environment where buyers can negotiate without fear of runaway inflation.

### Supply Dynamics
A significant increase in affordable housing supply is anticipated after 2026 in KL and Selangor. For the period of 2025–2028, Kuala Lumpur will see approximately 187 new launches, while Selangor is projected to have 559. In Cheras, this supply influx will likely temper drastic price increases, keeping the market competitive for buyers.

## 3. High-Rise vs. Landed Performance

Investors looking at Cheras condo investment versus landed homes must recognize the divergent trends between Cheras KL and Cheras Selangor.

### High-Rise Dominance in Cheras KL
Due to land scarcity and higher land costs, new developments in Cheras KL are overwhelmingly high-rise. Approximately 97.8% of new launches in Kuala Lumpur from 2025 to 2028 are high-rises.
*   **Pricing:** New condos in Cheras KL are priced between **RM400 and RM1,000 psf**.
*   **Performance:** Transit-oriented developments (TODs) near MRT lines, such as **Sunway Velocity Two** and **EkoCheras**, continue to command premiums and high occupancy due to connectivity.

### Landed Resilience in Cheras Selangor
Cheras Selangor (stretching towards Balakong and Kajang) remains the stronghold for landed properties.
*   **Pricing:** New launches here are generally priced between **RM350 and RM700 psf**.
*   **Demand:** Demand for landed homes remains robust among families seeking more space. However, availability is tightening; for instance, in the Petaling district (which borders parts of Cheras), only one new landed project is slated for completion in the near term.
*   **Outlook:** Landed prices are expected to appreciate faster than high-rises due to limited supply, particularly for freehold units in gated-and-guarded communities.

## 4. Rental Yield Outlook

The rental market in Cheras is forecast to remain healthy in 2026, driven by the area’s connectivity and educational institutions.

### Yield Expectations
Rental yields for high-rise residential properties in the Central Region generally range from **1.5% to 8.9%**. In Cheras, established condominiums near MRT stations or universities (like UCSI) perform at the higher end of this spectrum.
*   **High-End Examples:** Units at Sunway Velocity Two can command rentals as high as **RM5,500** for larger units.
*   **Mid-Range Market:** Older or mid-tier condos such as Shamelin Bestari offer affordable entry points for tenants, with rates around **RM1,500**.

### Budget 2026 Influence
The government's focus on "sustainable affordability" and rent-to-own schemes in Budget 2026 may slightly dampen rental demand in the lower-end segment as more tenants transition to homeownership using schemes like the [SJKP](/resources/housing-credit-guarantee-scheme-sjkp-2026). However, the foreign buyer stamp duty increase (from 4% to 8%) may encourage foreigners to rent rather than buy, potentially supporting the upper-mid rental market.

## 5. Infrastructure Impact on Property Values

Infrastructure remains the single biggest catalyst for capital appreciation in the Cheras property market 2026.

### The MRT Effect
The **Sungai Buloh-Kajang (SBK) MRT line** has fundamentally transformed Cheras. With 11 stations servicing the area—from Cochrane to Batu 11 Cheras—properties within walking distance of these stations enjoy a "rail premium". Academic research on the SBK line confirms that proximity to these transit hubs positively correlates with residential property prices, enhancing urban connectivity and value.

### Highway Connectivity
Beyond rail, highway upgrades continue to improve accessibility. The **Sungai Besi-Ulu Kelang Elevated Expressway (SUKE)** has alleviated some traffic bottlenecks, boosting the appeal of residential areas like Alam Damai and Taman Len Seng.

## 6. Best Areas in Cheras to Invest in 2026

Based on current trends and upcoming supply, the following areas represent the best opportunities for buyers and investors. Investors seeking a quieter, lower-density alternative to Cheras KL might prefer [Setiawangsa](/resources/setiawangsa-property-market-outlook-2026).

### 1. Taman Midah & Taman Pertama (Cheras KL)
*   **Why:** Mature neighbourhoods with direct MRT access, undergoing rejuvenation with modern high-rises.
*   **Target:** Investors looking for condo investment targeting white-collar workers in KL City Centre.

### 2. Sunway Velocity / Maluri
*   **Why:** Premier Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) hub. Integration of malls, medical centres, and MRT/LRT interchanges creates high rental demand.
*   **Target:** Investors seeking high rental yields and capital appreciation.

### 3. Taman Connaught
*   **Why:** Home to UCSI University and the famous night market.
*   **Target:** Buy-to-let investors targeting the student population.

### 4. Cheras South / Balakong (Cheras Selangor)
*   **Why:** Lower entry prices compared to KL with lifestyle amenities like Aeon Cheras Selatan and Dataran C180.
*   **Target:** Families and first-time homebuyers looking for spacious layouts or landed homes.

## 7. Risks and Challenges Buyers Should Know

While the outlook is positive, the Klang Valley property outlook is not without risks.

1.  **Residential Overhang:** While reducing, the overhang of unsold residential units remains a concern. Investors must be wary of buying into high-density developments with slow absorption rates.
2.  **Traffic Congestion:** Cheras is notorious for traffic. High-density developments in areas like Bandar Sri Permaisuri have exacerbated congestion.
3.  **Financing Costs:** Borrowing costs remain higher than pre-pandemic levels. Buyers must stress-test their finances.
4.  **Construction Costs:** Rising material costs may lead to smaller unit sizes (shrinkflation) in new launches.

## Conclusion

The Cheras property market 2026 offers a balanced landscape of opportunity and stability. The days of speculative flipping are largely over; the market is now driven by genuine demand and sustainable yield.

*   **For First-Time Homebuyers:** 2026 is an ideal time to enter the market. Leverage the [Budget 2026](/resources/malaysia-budget-2026-property-incentives) stamp duty exemptions for properties under RM500,000.
*   **For Investors:** Focus on Cheras condo investment within 500 meters of MRT stations. The "rail premium" is real.

**Final Verdict:** Cheras remains a resilient powerhouse in the Klang Valley property scene. However, success in 2026 will depend on strategic purchasing, focusing on connectivity and mature amenities.
